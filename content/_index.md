I owned a 1975 Cadillac Eldorado convertible from 2002 until 2010. I hope to someday own one again. When I owned it, I hand built a [Web 1.0 site](https://web.archive.org/web/20021211165958/http://www.remaker.com/caddy/), and discovered a [commmunity](https://web.archive.org/web/20030214090201/http://www.1975eldorado.com/) of owners and an amazing [Yahoo mailing list](https://thecml.groups.io/g/main). This website is a collection of my personal experience, stories, and some amalgamations of wisdom that I found useful. I converted it to a modern responsive website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and added https and IPv6 to make search engines like the content better. Let's see what happens.

The survival guide in the *Maintenance* area is a good place to start is the best place to start.
