For 2005, I got the crazy idea to add MORE lights to the Cadillac. With around 300 mini lights,
My tired old [WalMart Inverter](/images/xmas/2004/107_0786.JPG) struggled mightily under the load. When the car idled, the lights went din, or whout off altogether. The whole set would randomly shut down.

At work, I complained to my friend Rick who nodded patiently and empathtically at my predicament.

The next morning, he dropped off a giant 300W inverter with long tail of 10 gauge silvered wire terminated with endpoints designed for direct car battery connection.

"This should do the trick," he opined.

And it did. I love my friends.
