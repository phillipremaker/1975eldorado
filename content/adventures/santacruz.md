I had planned to [cruise to LA]({{<relref "toliveanddriveinla.md">}}) this week in my 1975 Eldorado Convertible, but my "shotgun" cancelled at the last minute due to a family illness. I was bummed, but didn't feel up to making the 350+ mile trek to LA by myself. So I was feeling a little sorry for myself when I found this out on Thursday, so I set off to make the most of my weekend.  

On Friday, I invited myself out to dinner with fellow 1975 Eldorado Convertible owner Tom Bombaci and his family. We hauled the entourage out for Japanese food in the landyacht. After we got back, we played some of his way cool video games in his basement, and did a night cruise out to the Santa Clara fairgrounds where folks were setting up for a pinball and video game auction. A nice cool top down night and some gratuitous driving. That helped the itch some.  

But then I got a surprise. An old gearhead friend from high school calls.He lives on the East Coast, and I in San Jose, CA. We see each other about once a year or so when he travels out to the west coast for business. He had yet to meet my Cadillac, and my family is out of town. So we agree to meet on Saturday (today).  

9AM:  Phone rings. Plan to meet at the Mariott Courtyard in Cupertino, and see where we end up.  

10:30AM:  Arrive at Marriot. Ben, who had a big fat Olds in High School, marvels at the way oversized beast rolling up to reception. He grins. He declines my offer to let him drive, preferring to take in all the sights instead. A quick tour of the features (including the working 8 track deck!) and off we go. Top down, and a nearly cloudless Northern California day.  

First stop:  [Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk](http://www.beachboardwalk.com). Hauling over the mountain on twisty CA route 17 is a treat in the new suspension, and the cool mountain breezes offset the throbbing hot sun. We roll up into Santa Cruz around 11:30 AM. We park and walk the length of the boardwalk, ride the [Giant Dipper](http://www.beachboardwalk.com/Giant-Dipper), and score some fountain soda to rehydrate. We stay long enough to compare to the Jersey shore of our youth, and then back in the Cadillac for the next stop.  

Ultimately, Ben needs to end up in San Francisco at Moscone Center for a conference. It is a good 75 miles away. The sane way to do it is to head back up 17 and catch 280 or 101 up to the city. But that is not what this day is for. No sir, no 6-lane superhighways for this cruise!  

We drive across Santa Cruz through the University part of town and pick up CA 1 north:  The Pacific Coast Highway. Normally, you can expect cold and fog, or blistering, relentless heat. But today, the gods have approved the ride and we have bright sunshine and a cool breeze. And no serious traffic. We tool up Highway 1 at a leisurely 50 mph, taking in all the sights. The oceans, the lighthouses, the cliffs, the beaches, and the mountains. Up to Half Moon Bay where we stop at Cameron's British Pub for a lunch of burgers and artery clogging deep fried yummies. Folks in the parking lot smile as we pull out of dock, and continue up the road, through Half Moon Bay, Montara, Pacifica, Daly City, and smack into the clog on Hospital Curve heading into The City.  

We creep through the San Francisco traffic, and jump off on Van Ness, where we loop around [City Hall](https://sfgov.org/cityhall/), Davies Symphony Hall, and the old buildings around the city center. We spin around to catch the Bay Bridge off to Treasure island where we marvel at the clear skies and the San Francisco skyline. A few misguided turns later, we are on to the Embarcadero and driving across the waterfront.  

Looking for the infamous Lombard Street, but a few wrong turns swing us into Union Square and back into the financial district. With a few more fortuitous turns we get up Hyde and turn on to Lombard, Wheeeee!!! Piloting the 20 foot blue monster down the tight twisties of Lombard street. It fits!!!  There are a few hills along the way to and from Lombard where the Eldo's gargantuan hood hides the crest of the hill, and a few tense moments as I lift out of my seat to try to see over hill crests. But lo, we survive to tell the tale.  

After finding a few narrow streets with scant inches to spare on either side of the behemoth, we ultimately work our way to Telegraph Hill and drop by Coit tower, to take in the city sights. We pass through Chinatown on the way to Moscone where I finally drop off my friend at about 5:30. He thanks me for the ride and though he is not a fan of convertibles, he enjoyed the 150 mile cruise around the Bay area in an American Icon. He has also been to San Francisco a number of times, and commented that driving through the city was a totally different experience in such a big car with no roof!  

I load up my MP3 player with tunes and set off rocketing down highway 280, where I sail home at 75 mph, smooth as glass. I just got home, and boy am I amped up. I'm also WAY sunburned. Mental note:  Sunscreen and a hat, dumbass. That SPF zero roof was not offering any protection.  

It's days like this where I don't mind the fact that my car sucks down so much money. This is the kind of day that I live for. I had a lot of things I could have been doing today and I should have been a responsible adult.But I traded that all in for some automotive joy. After I rest up a little, I'll get on that responsible adult crap.  

Happy cruising, folks. Never miss an opportunity to hit the road.
