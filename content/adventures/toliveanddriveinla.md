The philosophy of this cruise is to pack as much tourist-crap-you-can-do-in-a-covertible into a weekend trip, 12 hours of which is already eaten up getting to and from the greater LA Metroplitian area.  The basic idea is to drive everywhere that you have heard of, eat at only famous places, and find every boulevard even mentioned in a rock and roll song and drive down it.  

**Driving**  

*   Mulholland between Cahuenga and Coldwater Canyon
*   Ledgewood drive to the Hollywood Sign
*   Hollywood between La Brea and Argyle
*   Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena
*   The 110 to the 105 to Crenshaw Boulevard
*   Santa Monica Boulevard

**Dining**

*   [Mel's Drive In](http://www.melsdrive-in.com/) on Sunset (Googie)
