Shhh, Its a secret.  An idea.  Madness.  Total madness, even.

On the weekend of 6/25/2004, I have a vision:  An idea that is insane, indefensible, and whatever other in-word you can think of.

My wife and kids... gone.
Sean's wife and kids... gone.
Steve's wife and kids... understanding of Steve's need for a break.

My car has a new suspension.  It looks like crap, but it can drive.

It can drive a long way.

A long, long way.

It can go to the place it was *born* to go.  The place of legends.  The Entertainment Capital of the World. The Land of Elvis Impersonators, Cadillacs, and Dan Tanner.

Las Vegas, Nevada.

That's right.  With no air conditioning, we will sail the 8 1/2 hour journey across the desert, top down 24x7, slathered in SPF 50.  Eating bugs, burning skin, and mussing our hair all to show up in a place where we will not spend a penny gambling.  Except for the utter lack of drugs, Hunter Thompson would be proud.

Put 44 PSI in the tires, 30 gallons of Texas Tea in the tank, and gallons of drinking water in the back seat.  Load up the 8 tracks, and wire up the MP3 player.  Cut your hair short, stock up on chap stick.  Get some cheap sunglasses, a change of clothes, and a bad attitude.  And roll.

The itinerary includes cruising the arcades on the strip, marveling at the Hoover Dam, getting a chocolate buzz at the Ethel M chocolate factory, and roller-coastering at the stratosphere.  Drinking virgin Pina Coladas on faux beaches, and rocking out at the Hard Rock casino.  Hitting the water park in the 130 degree heat.  Marveling at the New York skyline.  Making an archeological dig at Luxor, and looking at the Tigers That Ate Sigfried and Roy.  Sleep all day, adventure all night.  Invert the sleeping schedule, and hide from the cruel desert sun.  Big Gulps all around.

Yes, my friends.  Madness.  Madness writ large.  I have lots to do:  Work, homework, community service, long term financial planning... All of that adult responsibility crap.  I would be well advised to abandon such folly. You should even devote your energy to disabusing me of the notion.

But.

I can hear it.

The beckoning of Las Vegas Boulevard.

My need to drive my 30 year old beater down the strip.  To take it so see its home, its roots, the place where it belongs.  To thumb my nose at the newer slicker cars, and the well dressed gold-lam√© clad beautiful people. To slum it into town in the great landshark, in the night, awash in the manic glittering of megawatts of wantonly squandered energy.

My wife will kill me.  
"Where did you get all this Las Vegas Memorabilia?" \
"Las Vegas"  
"Whaaaaaaaaat!!?!?!"

So, think about it.  Talk me out of it.  Get on board.  Think about what you'll pack.  Or laugh and delete the message.

I think I may be serious.  Do you hear the call?

Far be it from my friends to talk sense into me.  Here was a typical follow up messages.

In order to sweeten the deal, here is what I propose bringing:

1. my personal spud bazooka -- uses hairspray, and can probably put a potato through a windshield at 30 paces.  An amazing (and necessary) accessory for a road trip to LV in a convertable.  Imagine all the kangaroos we can waste on the way there...

2. some form of guitar that can plug into an amp of some sort that plugs into your car in some way that allows me to stand in the back seat and channel Elvis while driving down the strip at 15 miles an hour...

3. survival gear, in case the climate suddenly changes and/or the Koreans nuke the Western seaboard and we have to fight the irradiated human vampire mutants and whatnot when the local 7-11 runs out of sunflower seeds and big gulps -- I mean come on, Nevada has prostitutes, so they shouldn't have a problem with guns and ammo in the trunk of the Elvis-mobile.... right?
